# pod_luck, SUTD Library Study Pod Availability Checker
##### A SUTD Digital World Open Project (10.009)

### Problem Scope
The study pods on L3 of library always unavailable due to popularity.
Looking for a study pod can be time consuming and tedious.

### Proposed Solution
Develop a system whereby students can easily look up on the availability of studypods in the library.

#### Development
Using Ultrasonic sensors to detect availability of study pods. [Usage of sensors project requirement]
Make the data available on a (easy to use) website where any user with the link can access. [GUI project requirement]

### Further Development
We believe that it will be extremely useful, especially nearing exam periods as everyone will be looking for a place to study and time becomes more precious.
We hope that we will be able to further implement this idea to other communal areas such as other parts of the library, hostel spaces and other open spaces around the school campus.
